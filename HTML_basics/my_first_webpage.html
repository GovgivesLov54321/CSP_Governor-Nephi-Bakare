        <h1>Basketball: Who, What, Where, When, Why, How</h1>
        <h2>The Humble Birth</h1>
        <p>In December of 1891, James Naismith invented one of the greatest games known to man: basketball.
            Naismith was a 31-year-old PE instructor at the then International YMCA Training School in Sprinfield Massachusetts (now Sprinfield College). He wanted an alernative sport to (American) football, which had a high injury rate, that could also be played indoors. He had peach baskets on he walls, a soccer ball, and nine players on each team. By around 1897, the norm for teams became five players at a time on a court.
