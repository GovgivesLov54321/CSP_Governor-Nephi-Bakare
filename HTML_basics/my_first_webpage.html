        <h1>Basketball: Who, What, Where, When, Why, How</h1>
        <h2>The Humble Birth</h1>
        <p>In December of 1891, James Naismith invented one of the greatest games known to man: basketball.
            Naismith was a 31-year-old PE instructor at the then International YMCA Training School in Sprinfield Massachusetts (now Sprinfield College). He wanted an alernative sport to (American) football, which had a high injury rate, that could also be played indoors. He had peach baskets on he walls, a soccer ball, and nine players on each team. By around 1897, the norm for teams became five players at a time on a court.

        <h3>What Happened After?</h2>
            <p>Basketball eventually got adopted as a sport in the 1896 Summer Olmypics in Berlin. It also became a collegiate sport, and was played nation-wide by colleges by around 1900. The first professional league NBL (National Baskeball League) was formed in 1898, and disbanded in 1904. It then came back in 1935 as the MBC (Midwest Basketball Conference), and changed back to the NBL to avoid confusion with a collegiate basketball conference. Another pro league was foundeded in 1946: the BAA (Basketball Association of America). It merged with the older and bigger NBL to form what is known today as the NBA (National Basketball Association).
